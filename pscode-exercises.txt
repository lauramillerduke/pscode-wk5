// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
ask for a number
if number is divisible by 2 with no remainder (num %2 == 0)
 print Even
	else print Odd. 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers (num1, num2, etc)
	for numbers 1-5 find max
	print max " this is the largest number"
for numbers 1-5 find min
	print min " this is the smallest number"
add numbers 1-5 = sum
	divide sum by 5 = average 
print average and " this is the average"
